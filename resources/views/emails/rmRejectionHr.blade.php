	Dear HR,

	<br />
	<p>I trust this email finds you in good health.</p>
	<br />
	<p>I wish to inform you, following a through assessment, that we have
		decided not to proceed with the confirmation of {{$name}}.
		Consequently, an extension of the probationary period is deemed
		necessary. In case, if you have any inquiries or require additional
		information, please do not hesitate to reach out.</p>
	<br />
	<p>Reason - {{$reason}}</p>
	<br />
	<p>Regards,</p>
